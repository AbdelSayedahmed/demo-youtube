## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use the following command:

Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will run the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building for Deployment

To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

Using npm:
