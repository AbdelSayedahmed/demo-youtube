        Hello, my name is Abdel. I am an aspiring software engineer currently
        pursuing a career in full-stack development. My passion for programming
        began in high school, and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since. Besides coding, I
        have a strong interest in cars and computers. In my free time, I enjoy
        working on cars and building gaming rigs. I love the process of coding
        and creating new things. Additionally, I excel at debugging and finding
        quick solutions to complex problems.
